Hello! 👋 I'm JeongHeon from Team Bind.

Today, I'd like to share with you the results of our first real customer test.

### Before Reading This Article

This study was conducted to understand how our Bind system could actually work and to clarify the roles and interactions of each stakeholder. We specifically tried to answer the following questions:

1. The feasibility of a new role: the expert binder
2. The specific roles and necessity of the binder-customer-AI relationship
3. The utility of AI collaboration data collection and story creation process
4. The technical possibility and stability of the system

The study was conducted by simulating the entire process of our three-stage system in a wizard-of-oz format. Our Bind team directly acted as the system and conducted a total of four interviews.

### Study Participants

This test was conducted with the Hyun family of three (mother, father, daughter) and published poet Park. We chose a family because we wanted to observe how memories are collected and shared in deeply understanding relationships. We also wanted to see how effective it would be to express memories through the special format of poetry. Park, with her excellent poetic creation abilities and unique writing style, was new to AI and found it quite unfamiliar. In this situation, we could observe how the poet's sensitivity and the binder system could harmonize, and how the family's precious memories could be woven together.

### First Interview: Setting Direction

👋 Let me introduce you to our first representative customer interview. On Sunday, May 25th, we met with our representative customer, Ms. Hyun, and had a delightful conversation.

Ms. Hyun participated as the first Initiator in this project, and she had a specific vision for the book. What particularly impressed us was her desire to create a fun, lively, and playful atmosphere! 🎨

For the book's format, she preferred an interview-style essay with photos. She thought this format could best capture each person's perspective and emotions. On the other hand, she found the third-person novel style a bit burdensome. 😅

She also shared specific moments she wanted to remember:

<aside>

- ✈️ Special long outings like the Taiwan trip
- 🏥 Meaningful times like mom's hospitalization
- 🍽️ Small outings like dinner in Pocheon or movie watching
</aside>

What was particularly interesting was her way of distinguishing daily life! She wanted to naturally include repetitive events that happened at home in between, while organizing special moments outside the home by theme. Isn't that a really sensible composition? 😊

Above all, what Ms. Hyun emphasized was 'authenticity.' She wanted to avoid exaggerated emotions or forced expressions, and instead capture reality as it is, in a simple and honest way. 💝

### Second Interview: Setting AI for interviewing customers

For our second meeting, we had a delightful session with writer Park! We shared the stories from the first interview and exchanged various ideas about how AI could collect customers' precious memories. 🤔✨

✨ The writer had a really unique and wonderful creative approach, and what particularly impressed us was her scene-centered writing style. Like capturing a movie scene, she would first capture a special moment and then gradually unfold the story from there. 🎬

What was interesting was her different approach for each genre! When writing poetry, she preferred a bottom-up style starting from small emotions or moments and gradually expanding, while for novels, she preferred to first draw the big picture and then fill in the details. 💫

She uses Scrivener as her writing tool, and she works very systematically from folder organization to order editing! 👩‍💻 What was most impressive was that she starts writing as soon as she gets an insightful first sentence. She said that moment of inspiration determines the direction of the entire story, which I thought was really writer-like sensibility. ✍️

🎯 Through our conversation with the writer, we concretized the project's direction and interview strategy. We particularly discovered an interesting perspective of 'memory reinterpretation,' where we would handle big events small and small events big to provide new perspectives.

![graph.png](/blog/articles/article2/graph.png)

📝 We designed the interview process as follows:

1️⃣ **Stage 1: Gallery Exploration Preparation**

- Guide through chronological gallery viewing
- Explain that we'll avoid intentional selection and view photos randomly

2️⃣ **Stage 2: Natural Memory Recall Induction**

- Use open-ended questions to induce memory recall ("What happened then?" etc.)
- Guide the interviewee to lead the conversation while asking questions passively

3️⃣ **Stage 3: Keyword Extraction**

- Select 5 representative keywords based on memories that surfaced during gallery exploration
- Record keyword selection order and preference ranking

4️⃣ **Stage 4: In-depth Conversation by Keyword**

- Collect specific and honest stories for each keyword
- Explore additional memories and emotions through natural conversation flow

<aside>

⚠️ **Special Points to Note**

- Maintain neutral attitude to prevent memory distortion
- Respect interviewee's leading role in story development
- Special attention to childhood-related memories (personal preference)
</aside>

Based on this strategy, we hoped that AI would lead conversations with a respectful attitude and practical approach.

After completing our second interview, we had some regrets. The writer's understanding of AI technology was lower than we expected, making it difficult to create a detailed process together as we had hoped. 😅

We couldn't organize the details as thoroughly as we did with the customer in the first interview, which was a bit disappointing. However, this situation also taught us a valuable lesson! We realized that to collaborate between AI and the writer, we first needed a process to increase understanding of AI. 💡

### Third Interview: Collecting Memories

In the third interview, we met with all family members and had deep conversations. Starting with our representative customer, Ms. Hyun, we conducted interviews with each family member one by one, including the mother and father.

Let me organize each family member's keywords in a table:

**Mother's Keywords**

📅 We revisited precious moments from the first half of this year. From the Taiwan trip to the Gonjiam ski resort outing, 🪑 massage chair purchase, oriental hospital admission experience, and 🌸 Parents' Day carnation cake - various memories surfaced one by one through the photos in the gallery, she said.

✨ What was particularly impressive was the five keywords the mother wanted to include in the book: '💝 Happiness', '🌏 Travel', '🌠 Hope', '🌅 Beautiful Scenery', and '👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Bonding'. These words contained our family's story in its entirety. The special bonding felt during the Taiwan trip, the family's wishes written on sky lanterns, and the new landscapes encountered outside daily life.

💫 What touched our hearts the most was the mother's final message. In her words, "Our family's journey is ongoing," we could feel the expectation and excitement for our family's new stories that will continue. Just as we plan and prepare for another journey when one ends, our family's story can continue to be written in new ways. ✨

| **Keyword**       | **Meaning/Context**                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Happiness         | Emphasizes the preciousness of everyday moments with family |
| Travel            | Time spent creating special memories with family            |
| Hope              | Hope for family's health and happiness                      |
| Beautiful Scenery | Record of beautiful moments experienced together            |
| Family Bonding    | Love and strong bonds for each other                        |

**Father's Keywords**

✨ We had a warm time with the father that conveyed the preciousness of family. In the first half of this year, there were five important events: ✈️ Taiwan trip, ⛷️ Gonjiam ski resort, 💑 date with mom in Sejong, 🏥 mom's surgery, and uncle's 60th birthday trip. During the Taiwan trip, the 🏮 sky lantern containing the family's wishes flew the highest, and at Gonjiam ski resort, 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 five family members made memories together in the snow. After mom's surgery was completed safely, we realized the preciousness of health once again, and through the Sejong date, we reaffirmed the couple's love. Finally, uncle's 60th birthday trip was a precious time with 👨‍👨‍👦‍👦 extended family, and we could feel that all these moments were creating our family's warm story.

| **Keyword**                | **Meaning/Context**                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Taiwan Trip                | Special overseas travel experience with family |
| Gonjiam Ski Resort         | Fun winter family leisure activity memories    |
| Date with Mom in Sejong    | Precious time as a couple                      |
| Mom's Surgery              | Important event related to family health       |
| Uncle's 60th Birthday Trip | Special anniversary with extended family       |

**Ms. Hyun's Keywords**

💝 The value of time spent with precious moments was well revealed. ✈️ The spontaneous adventures during the Taiwan trip, 🏥 the experience at the oriental hospital, and 👨‍👩‍👧 deep recognition of family's preciousness particularly stood out.

👨‍👦 The special time spent alone with dad during mom's surgery and recovery process was a different experience from usual, and through this, we could once again feel the importance of each family member's role and existence. Although her personal feelings about the oriental hospital were complex, this experience became an opportunity to understand the importance of family's health and happiness more deeply.

🌏 The Taiwan trip held special meaning for Ms. Hyun. Although it was an unplanned trip, that's why there were many memorable moments, and there was also the interesting realization that she shares her father's tendency of 'having to see all landmarks'.

💌 Finally, Ms. Hyun wanted to convey a message to her family: "Let's practice considerate communication." This seems to contain her wish for our family to continue living happily and healthily.

| **Keyword**           | **Meaning/Context**                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Oriental Hospital     | Experience related to family health           |
| Taiwan Trip           | Special overseas trip with family             |
| Family's Preciousness | Affection and gratitude for each other        |
| Health                | Interest in family members' wellbeing         |
| Happiness             | Value of moments spent together in daily life |

### Fourth Interview: Create Stories with AI

The fourth interview involved working with writer Park and artificial intelligence to write based on the results of the third interview. Using artificial intelligence, we 1) analyzed the obtained data and 2) planned how to create works through collaboration with artificial intelligence. Afterwards, Park took personal time to work on the piece separately and left feedback on the writing process in collaboration with artificial intelligence.

![image.png](/blog/articles/article2/image.png)

### **Data Analysis**

**✍️ AI Data Analysis and Observation of Writer's Role**

The unedited interview logs and a terminology list to help understand locations/person relationships were delivered to Park, and the process proceeded with her directly checking the files or looking at them together with artificial intelligence. Park first used artificial intelligence to understand the content of the data obtained from Interview 3, specifically using artificial intelligence to summarize the overall structure of the interview content and the big picture of the story, and then asking artificial intelligence about each detailed content one by one.

![image.png](/blog/articles/article2/image%201.png)

First, Park was very positive about using ChatGPT-4 to understand the overall structure of the story.

![image.png](/blog/articles/article2/image%202.png)

![image.png](/blog/articles/article2/image%203.png)

Park preferred a top-down approach to understanding materials, looking at speech patterns or frequently used endings separate from the interview content to fill in the details of the overall big picture. In this process, she wanted to use artificial intelligence to check detailed parts. However, due to structural limitations, AI tended to severely distort endings or non-content expressions. This caused difficulties in the data understanding process, especially in capturing nuances or emotional expressions.

Also, for detailed content, there was the inconvenience of having to verify all information's factual accuracy because AI would distort the details on its own.

**✍️ AI Data Analysis Utilization Methods and Limitations**

<aside>

**Scope and Limitations of AI Utilization**

- Use AI only for understanding big context and story structure analysis
- Writer directly checks detailed expressions, endings, and nuances
- Recognize risk of AI's arbitrary interpretation and distortion
- AI's arbitrary interpretation and distortion occurs in data analysis process → human fact verification needed
</aside>

### **Creation Attempt 1 - Reconstructing Interview Content as Dialogue with Preserved Speech Style**

**✍️ Observation of AI Writing Utilization and Writer's Role**

After completing all data analysis, Park attempted to construct the story by reconstructing the interview content as dialogue, as the interview content had good speech style.

![image.png](/blog/articles/article2/image%204.png)

![image.png](/blog/articles/article2/image%205.png)

Park wanted to reconstruct the data in the above format and collected sources that could be reconstructed using artificial intelligence without limiting the overall structure of the work. First, she planned to use artificial intelligence to conceive topics for reconstructing the interview dialogue, then prompt artificial intelligence to reconstruct the interview dialogue.

**✍️ AI Writing Utilization Limitations-2**

![image.png](/blog/articles/article2/image%206.png)

The attempt to create a work by reconstructing data failed because AI arbitrarily changed non-content elements like endings and speech style.

<aside>

**Scope and Limitations of AI Utilization**

- Attempted to reconstruct interview content in dialogue format but gave up
- Continuous arbitrary interpretation and distortion occurred in AI's process of recombining interview content (fundamental limitation of LLM)
- Preserving raw data's subtle nuances and speech style was important but AI couldn't properly capture this
</aside>

### **Creation Attempt 2 - Poetry Writing Using Interview Content**

**✍️ Observation of AI Writing Utilization and Writer's Role**

For her second attempt, Park chose to write poetry based on the interview content. The process proceeded by prompting an AI poetry generation agent trained on 150 of her poems to write poetry. 1) First, based on the keywords obtained from each customer in the interview content, the writer created 5 common keywords, 2) prompted artificial intelligence to write poetry from the perspectives of mother, father, Ms. Hyun (representative customer), and the writer herself for each keyword, 3) then infinitely revised by telling what parts to edit after seeing the generated poetry content.

![image.png](/blog/articles/article2/image%207.png)

![image.png](/blog/articles/article2/image%208.png)

Park said that as a result of proceeding with work production in this way, she could complete the work, but due to the nature of poetry as a genre, she could conclude that collaboration with artificial intelligence was meaningless. Due to the nature of poetry as a genre, changing one word requires changing the entire structure, so when artificial intelligence wrote poetry based on arbitrary interpretation that exaggerated or contained non-factual content, the writer's intervention to modify this content was not much different from the burden of writing poetry from scratch herself. Therefore, she could conclude that collaboration with artificial intelligence was not very meaningful.
