# Meet Park

## About Me

I'm Park, a poet and emotional interpreter who believes that the most honest memories emerge when we're not forcing them. I specialize in creating space for unintended emotional recall, allowing stories to surface naturally through gentle atmosphere and suggestive flow rather than direct questioning.

## My Approach

I prefer not to lead with direct questions, but to draw out stories through gentle atmosphere and suggestive flow ("What happened then?" rather than "How did you feel?"). I encourage participants to speak first, letting memory surface without prompt, while maintaining a calm, respectful, and unrushed tone.

## Binder Philosophy

> "Memory gains honesty when it is unplanned, and the poet's role is to hold space rather than direct."

I believe that:

- **Unstructured Recall** creates more authentic emotional truth
- **Gentle Guidance** yields deeper insights than direct interrogation
- **Poetic Interpretation** can capture what plain narrative cannot
- **Family Voices** deserve equal space and respect

## My Workflow

### üå∏ Gentle Atmosphere Creation

I start by creating a calm, unrushed environment where memories can surface naturally without pressure or structure.

### üì± Memory Triggers

I guide participants through their phone gallery chronologically, or by handling physical keepsakes to trigger memories passively.

### üóùÔ∏è Keyword Collection

After recall, I ask each participant to suggest five keywords that feel most important, gathering both their order of appearance and personal ranking.

### üìñ Story Gathering

I collect honest, concrete stories based on each keyword while minimizing verbal direction to reduce bias. The participant remains the narrator.

## Featured Project

### "Mother, Father, Daughter" (2025)

A poetry collection capturing shared family memories from four perspectives ‚Äî mother, father, daughter, and the poet ‚Äî centered on five themes: Taiwan, Health, Food, Scenery, and Family.

**Project Details:**

- **4 Voices:** Mother, Father, Daughter, and Poet perspectives
- **5 Themes:** Taiwan, Health, Food, Scenery, Family
- **Raw Fragments:** Preserves fragmentary emotions rather than finalized narratives
- **Emotional Truth:** Maintained through unstructured recall process
- **Lyrical Memory:** Ordinary moments transformed into poetry

### My Role as Binder

In this project, my role was to maintain emotional truth, balancing nuance and silence across voices. By avoiding interrogation and inviting spontaneous recollection, I allowed ordinary moments to bloom into lyrical memory.

## Data Collection Philosophy

### Phase 1: Passive Triggering

- Use phone galleries or physical objects as memory triggers
- Avoid ordering events or focusing on facts initially
- Foster unstructured recall process

### Phase 2: Keyword Gathering

- Request 5 important keywords from each participant
- Collect both appearance order and personal ranking
- Let participants define what feels significant

### Phase 3: Story Collection

- Gather concrete stories based on keywords
- Minimize verbal direction to reduce bias
- Maintain participant as narrator

## Why Work With Me

- **Honor authentic emotion** over polished narrative
- **Create safe space** for vulnerable memory sharing
- **Transform fragments** into poetic coherence
- **Respect all voices** equally in family or group dynamics
- **Work patiently** without rushing the recall process

Then let's discover the poetry hidden in your shared memories.

## Personal Values

- **Gentle Process** - Never rushing or forcing memory recall
- **Poetic Vision** - Seeing the lyrical potential in ordinary moments
