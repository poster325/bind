# 티디를 풀어서 부르자면

What started as a simple idea to document our university band's final year together became something much more profound—a collective yearbook that captures not just our music, but the dreams, bonds, and raw emotions that defined our twenties.

## The Genesis of a Dream

Seven strangers brought together by music, each carrying their own hopes and fears about the future. As our final year approached, we realized that our individual stories were incomplete without each other. This realization sparked the creation of "Twenties Dream 2024"—a collaborative narrative that would preserve not just our memories, but the essence of who we were becoming.

## The Collaborative Process

Creating a collective story required a new approach to storytelling:

### Emotional Mapping Sessions

- Weekly gatherings where each member shared pivotal moments
- Identifying common themes across different perspectives
- Mapping the emotional landscape of our shared journey

### AI-Assisted Memory Curation

- Using AI tools to help organize and connect scattered memories
- Generating prompts that unlocked forgotten moments
- Creating narrative threads that wove individual stories together

### Collective Writing Workshops

- Collaborative editing sessions where we refined each other's stories
- Finding the balance between individual voice and group harmony
- Ensuring every member felt authentically represented

## Themes That Emerged

Through our process, five major themes crystallized:

1. **Friendship**: The unexpected bonds that formed through late-night rehearsals
2. **Music**: How sound became the language of our connection
3. **Growth**: The ways we challenged and changed each other
4. **Dreams**: Individual aspirations that somehow aligned
5. **Youth**: The bittersweet awareness of a chapter ending

## The Power of Collective Memory

What surprised us most was how our individual memories were transformed when shared. Events that seemed ordinary to one person held profound meaning for another. Moments of doubt became sources of strength when viewed through the lens of friendship.

## Beyond the Band

"Twenties Dream 2024" became more than a yearbook—it became a template for how young people can document their most formative years. By combining traditional storytelling with modern tools and collective wisdom, we created something that honors both individual experience and shared growth.

The project taught us that the most meaningful stories aren't just about what happened, but about how we helped each other become who we were meant to be.
