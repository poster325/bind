# 시제: 엄마, 아빠, 딸

When a family approached me to help preserve their shared memories, I discovered that the most profound stories emerge not from structured interviews, but from the gentle spaces where memory naturally surfaces. "Mother, Father, Daughter" became a testament to the power of unintended emotional recall.

## The Art of Gentle Memory Work

Traditional storytelling often relies on direct questioning and chronological narrative. But I've found that the most authentic family stories emerge when we create space for memories to surface organically, triggered by simple objects, photographs, or sensory experiences.

### The Five-Keyword Method

Working with this family, I developed a gentle approach centered on five emotional themes that emerged naturally from our conversations:

- **Taiwan**: The homeland that shaped family identity
- **Health**: Unspoken fears and hopes around aging
- **Food**: Recipes as vessels for cultural transmission
- **Scenery**: Places that hold the essence of family moments
- **Family**: The complex web of love, duty, and dreams

## Four Perspectives, One Story

What made this project unique was how the same memories held different emotional weights for each family member:

### The Mother's Voice

Her memories centered on preservation—keeping traditions alive, maintaining connections to Taiwan, ensuring the family recipes wouldn't be lost. Through her phone gallery, we discovered how she documented every family meal, every celebration, as acts of love.

### The Father's Perspective

His recollections focused on adaptation—how to honor the past while building a future in a new country. His stories revealed the quiet sacrifices and small victories that shaped the family's journey.

### The Daughter's Experience

Her memories bridged two worlds—the Taiwan of her parents' stories and the reality of her own life. Through gentle exploration, we uncovered how she carried both cultures within her, creating something entirely new.

### The Poet's Role

My task was to hold space for all these voices without imposing structure or interpretation. By avoiding direct questions and instead creating gentle atmosphere, I allowed each person's authentic voice to emerge.

## The Power of Unstructured Recall

The breakthrough came when I stopped asking "What happened?" and started creating conditions where memories could surface naturally:

- **Phone Gallery Exploration**: Scrolling through photos chronologically, letting images trigger unexpected recollections
- **Sensory Triggers**: The smell of certain foods, the texture of old photographs, the sound of familiar music
- **Gentle Atmosphere**: Creating unhurried space where silence was welcome and memories could emerge at their own pace

## Transforming Fragments into Poetry

The final collection preserves the fragmentary nature of memory while revealing the deeper emotional truths that connect generations. Rather than creating a linear narrative, we honored the way memory actually works—in flashes, associations, and emotional resonances.

Each poem captures a moment where past and present intersect, where individual experience becomes part of a larger family story, where the ordinary reveals itself as profound.

## Beyond Documentation

"Mother, Father, Daughter" became more than a family memoir—it became a meditation on how memory works, how families preserve and transform culture across generations, and how poetry can capture what prose cannot.

The project taught us that the most meaningful family stories aren't just about what happened, but about how we continue to carry each other forward, how we transform inherited memories into new possibilities, and how love expresses itself in the smallest, most ordinary moments.

_The most beautiful family stories are not told—they are recalled, felt, and gently shaped into poetry through patient listening._
