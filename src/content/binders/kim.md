# Meet Binder Kim

## About Me

I'm Kim, a fiction writer based in Daejeon who builds stories around emotion, not just events. As a Binder, I guide people to uncover personal truths and emotional turning points hidden in everyday moments. My goal is to curate memory-based stories that feel both cinematic and deeply human.

## My Approach

I treat every book like a narrative, with rising tension, a meaningful climax, and emotional closure. I begin not with a timeline, but with the heart of the story â€” a moment of impact â€” and build from there. When gathering memories, I focus on relationship dynamics, emotional shifts, and lived perspectives rather than just facts.

## Binder Mission

To discover each group's unique emotional arc, and to translate those invisible bonds into a shared memory artifact. I believe the best stories are not told â€” they are recalled, felt, and shaped through deep listening.

## Featured Project

### "Twenties Dream: 2024"

A story-driven yearbook for a university band navigating passion, burnout, and friendship.

**Project Details:**

- 7 participants (band members and close friends)
- Interviews guided around emotional climax, inter-member dynamics, and personal turning points
- Intentionally avoids dry chronological edits in favor of immersive narrative pacing
- Designed to capture raw moments and relational growth

## My Workflow as a Binder

### ðŸ§­ Climax-Oriented Structure

I begin from what each person feels is the most emotionally intense moment, then work backwards to make the story meaningful.

### ðŸŽ­ Character Through Connection

I explore how each member relates to others â€” who they felt close to, distanced from, or changed by.

### ðŸ’¡ Emotion Over Facts

I don't ask everyone to recall everything. Some give timeline structure, others offer texture through feelings and perspective.

### ðŸ§µ Story from Fragments

I connect casual voice memos, texts, and conversation into a scene-based narrative with emotional logic.

### ðŸ¤– AI as Sketch Partner

I imagine an AI that not only listens, but sketches: generating visuals, capturing tone, and helping us feel the scene together.

## Binder Philosophy

> "The best stories are not told â€” they are recalled, felt, and shaped through deep listening."

I believe in:

- **Emotional Truth**: Finding the real story beneath the surface events
- **Relational Depth**: Understanding how people connect and change each other
- **Scene-Based Thinking**: Building narratives around powerful moments
- **Collaborative Creation**: Working with AI as a creative partner

## Why Work With Me

If you're looking for a binder who will:

- Find the emotional core of your shared experiences
- Create a narrative that feels like a compelling story, not just a chronicle
- Focus on relationships and personal growth rather than just events
- Use innovative AI tools to enhance the storytelling process

Then let's create something meaningful together.
